

Create a professional-grade website for learning Digital Image Processing (DIP) practicals. The website should meet the following specifications:

 1. General Requirements
Use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (via CDN), and ensure the website looks modern and visually appealing.
The website must have a dark mode with black backgrounds and appropriate color contrasts.
Include a collapsible sidebar that lists all the practicals, named appropriately (e.g., "Edge Detection: Prewitt", "Dilation and Erosion").
The sidebar should allow easy navigation to each practical.

 2. Content
Each practical page should contain:
  The title of the practical.
  The exact content from the provided PDF (do not modify or paraphrase).
  A section with code snippets that have a "Copy" button for copying the code directly.
  Proper headings and formatting for readability.

 3. Design
Use a clean and professional layout that looks like it was created by someone with 10+ years of web development experience.
Highlight the code sections using a terminal-like theme or syntax highlighting.
Ensure responsive design so that the website works well on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
  
 4. Sidebar Functionality
The sidebar should:
  Be expandable and collapsible.
  Show all the practicals at a glance.
  Allow users to search practicals by keywords (e.g., "Prewitt" or "Edge Detection").

 5. Dark Mode
Implement a toggle button for switching between dark and light modes.

 6. Technical Features
Provide smooth animations when interacting with the sidebar or toggling modes.
Include clear buttons for navigation and user interaction.

 7. Deployment
The entire website should be self-contained and ready for deployment.

 8. Additional Notes
Do not alter the content of the PDF. Ensure that the uploaded PDF content appears exactly as it is, formatted neatly for the web.
Maintain consistency across all pages.
Add a small footer with basic information like "Â© 2025 Digital Image Processing Practical Guide."
